# Biography

Doug A. Bowman is the Frank J. Maher Professor of Computer Science and Director of the
Center for Human-Computer Interaction at Virginia Tech. He is the principal investigator of the
3D Interaction Group, focusing on designing effective user experiences for virtual and
augmented reality, and on understanding effects of the level of fidelity in virtual environments.
Dr. Bowman is one of the co-authors of the seminal book 3D User Interfaces: Theory and
Practice. He has published more than 50 journal articles and more than 80 peer-reviewed
conference papers. He has received more than $7M in funding for his research from
government and industry sources, including the National Science Foundation, the Office of
Naval Research, DARPA, Google, and Microsoft. He has been invited to give keynote
addresses at seven international conferences.

Bowman has served in many roles for the IEEE Virtual Reality Conference, including program
chair, general chair, and steering committee chair. He also co-founded the IEEE Symposium on
3D User Interfaces (now part of IEEE VR). He has served on the editorial boards of five
journals, including the IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics and the
International Journal on Human-Computer Studies.

Bowman received the Technical Achievement award from the IEEE Visualization and Graphics
Technical Committee in 2014, and has been named an ACM Distinguished Scientist. With his
students, he has received first prize at the IEEE 3D User Interface Contest four times. He has
supervised 17 Ph.D. students to completion.

Bowman’s undergraduate degree in mathematics and computer science is from Emory
University, and he received his M.S. and Ph.D. in computer science from the Georgia Institute of
Technology.

# Candidate Statement

I am grateful for and humbled by my nomination as chair of the Visualization and Graphics
Technical Committee of the IEEE Computer Society. VGTC has provided important benefits to
me and to so many others over the years, and it continues to have a key role to play in
promoting research, scholarship, and community in important and rapidly growing areas such as
visualization and VR/AR.

My experience with VGTC-sponsored conferences goes back more than 20 years. I attended
my first IEEE Virtual Reality Annual International Symposium (which later became the IEEE VR
Conference) in 1996, and have not missed a single VR conference since. I have served in many
roles at the conference, including reviewer, program committee member, video chair, exhibits
chair, panels chair, and workshop organizer. I served as the program chair in 2006 and general
conference chair in 2007-2008. Finally, I served on the VR steering committee from 2009 until
this year, including a stint as chair from 2011 to 2014. In addition, I was privileged to be one of
the founding co-chairs of the IEEE Symposium on 3D User Interfaces, which was added to VR
as a pre-conference symposium in 2006. I served on its steering committee from 2006 to 2017,
when it was folded back into the main VR conference to reflect the first-class status of 3D UI
research and scholarship.

In my opinion, the flagship conferences of VGTC—VR, VIS, and ISMAR—are the premier
conference venues in the world for these areas of research. Maintaining the quality, rigor, and
stature of these conferences should be the primary objective of VGTC. At the same time,
outside of a relatively small academic community, our conferences do not have the reputation
they deserve. Especially at this time, when literally billions of dollars are being invested in visual
computing technologies, our community needs to be at the forefront of innovation and
scholarship to ensure that these technologies and experiences are being designed based on
rigorous, systematic, state-of-the-art research. To do that, VGTC conferences must have
improved visibility in industry. I will work to establish champions for VGTC conferences in the
most important tech industry companies, and to tout the benefits of VGTC conference
participation to our industry colleagues, without sacrificing the scientific quality of our
proceedings.

The other area for improvement is balance across all VGTC conferences. Our conferences have
unequal arrangements for journal special issues and unequal representation in the VGTC
leadership. I will work to bring all VGTC conferences into standard, most-beneficial agreements
with the IEEE TVCG journal, and to ensure that all of our conferences have an equal voice at
the TC level.
