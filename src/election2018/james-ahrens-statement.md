# Biography

James Ahrens is a senior scientist in the Applied Computer Science Group at Los Alamos National
Laboratory. His primary research interests are visualization, computer graphics, data science and parallel
systems. Dr. Ahrens is author of over 100 peer reviewed papers and the founder/design lead of
ParaView, an open-source visualization tool designed to handle extremely large data. ParaView is
broadly used for scientific visualization, downloaded approximately a half million times per year, and is
in use at supercomputing and scientific centers worldwide.

Ahrens has extensive management experience as a technical program manager. He has over twenty
awards as a principal or co-investigator from the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. National
Science Foundation. These awards have evolved in scope over the course of his career to multi-million
dollar, interdisciplinary, data analysis/visualization projects involving multiple partners from academia,
laboratories and industry. For example, Ahrens is currently the U.S. Exascale Computing Projectâ€™s Data
and Visualization lead for thirteen storage, data management and visualization projects that will be a key
part of a vibrant exascale supercomputing application and software ecosystem.

Dr. Ahrens provides leadership to the international visualization community as a member of the IEEE
Visualization Executive Committee and as an Associate Editor for IEEE Transaction on Visualization
and Computer Graphics. He is active in conference organization as the general chair for IEEE
Visualization in 2017 and as papers chair in 2015 and 2016. He also helped start the successful Large
Data Analysis and Visualization Symposium (LDAV) held at IEEE Visualization. This year, he
championed a short paper track for the Scientific Visualization conference to bring the students,
practitioners and industry participants to IEEE Visualization.

Dr. Ahrens received his B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in
1989 and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Washington in 1996. When relaxing he
enjoys cycling, mountain biking, triathlons, reading science fiction and spending time with his family.

# Candidate Statement

The mission of the IEEE Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee (VGTC) and its chair is to
provide forums for the exchange and the sharing of ideas, techniques, standards and experiences in the
areas of visualization, computer graphics, virtual reality and augmented reality. These topics are critical
part of the fabric of our evolving technological society impacting how we learn, understand and interact
with information, one another, and the world. VGTC supports workshops, conferences and professional
development for practitioners, researchers, developers, users and students.

I believe my experience working on large multi-institution, multi-disciplinary projects and my leadership
in the IEEE Visualization community make me a great candidate for the VGTC chair role. The breadth
of the VGTC mission, supporting academic forums, professional development, industry outreach and
engagement, and communicating with and listening to the range of opinions from community members
requires a chair who has experience successfully working with many stakeholders.

I believe in a set of guiding principles when achieving VGTC objectives: 1) timely communication to
and from community members 2) transparency and clarity in the decision-making process and a 3)
reduction of complexity and exceptions in operations. I believe we are a stronger community when all
our members are supported, represented and included. Therefore, I will support inclusion activities for
all VGTC sponsored conferences. I also support increased industry and practitioner engagement to
promote a focus on real-world problem solving.
